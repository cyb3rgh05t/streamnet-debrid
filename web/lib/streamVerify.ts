/**
 * Truth-based playability verification.
 *
 * The badge on a source row is inferred from its release NAME — codec, audio
 * and container guessed from text. That guess is wrong often enough that users
 * hit "Plays here" sources that never play, and each failure mode has needed
 * its own hand-written rule (TrueHD companions, Dolby Vision base layers,
 * single-track DDP web-dls). Adding rules per report does not scale.
 *
 * This module answers the same question by READING the file: mediabunny pulls
 * the container header over a couple of range requests and the browser itself
 * says whether it can decode each track. No release-name heuristics.
 *
 * It is deliberately separate from `streamCompatibility`, which stays the fast
 * synchronous guess used to order and label the list on first paint. Verified
 * results refine that list once they arrive.
